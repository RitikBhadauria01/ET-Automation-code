Once the email is identified, robot downloads the attachment and do the further processing.  The authorized email IDs are defined in the mapping file which is kept over business Sharepoint. Once we receive email from any planner, the email ID is validated from the excel list and upon successful validation of planner and the correct subject line, robot downloads the order form and proceed with order creation. S1 accounts will be added or removed from the mapping file as and when people will join or leave the organization. The ownership of maintaining mapping file totally lies with business function. • What are the steps that BOT performs? – short description in bullet points   1. Download the Order form from the email 2. Create the order in S1P w.r.t. the details inside the order form using VA01 3. Generate the proforma out of SAP using VF01 and VF02 4. Acknowledge the business through email  • Does the BOT do financial posting?  No financial posting at all. It’s only pertaining to Sales Order Creation.","gcadApprover":"","gcadApprovalStatus":null,"gcadComments":"","gcadApprovalDate":"2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","businessOwnerComments":"","firstLevelControlActivity":null,"UserEmail":"sharma4, chirag"}]
